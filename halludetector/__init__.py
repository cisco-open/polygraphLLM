# By default the root logger is set to WARNING and all loggers you define
# inherit that value. Here we set the root logger to NOTSET. This logging
# level is automatically inherited by all existing and new sub-loggers
# that do not set a less verbose level.
logging.root.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# The following line sets the root logger level as well.
# It's equivalent to both previous statements combined:
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
